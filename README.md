# Coding-Pop-Quiz
Description 

I wanted to create a simple Quiz application where the user can answer a few questions and record their scores

When the application is first opened it will display a start button with a quick introduction to how it works 

Once the user clicks on the start button it will disappear and the first question will be presented along with a timer starting at 60 seconds 
If the user answers the question correctly they will increase their score by one. If they answer incorrectly they will lose 10 seconds off of their current time 

Once the last question is answered the questions will disappear and they will be presented with a text box where they can record their initials and their high score. They can then retake the quiz for a chance to get a higher score
